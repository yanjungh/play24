# The Make 24 Game

This is a popular game to play with friends and family.  It's especially good one to play with kids in the 
grade schools, because it really helps them to get fluent with the four basic math operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division.

You can play this game by:
   1. using a deck of cards and pick 4 random ones from 1 to 10.
   2. or one player randomly picks up 4 numbers, and the others try to solve it.

For example, say you've got below numbers:
    2 3 7 8
    
One way to make 24 is: ((2 + 7) / 3) * 8
